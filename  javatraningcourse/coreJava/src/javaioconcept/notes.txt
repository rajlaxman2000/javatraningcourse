File reader : 
	FileReaders are usually wrapped by higher-level objects such as BufferedReaders, which improve 
	performance and provide more convenient ways to work with the data.
	

File writer : 
	FileWriters are usually wrapped by higher-level Writer objects such as BufferedWriters or
	PrintWriters, which provide better performance and higher-level, more flexible methods to write data.
	
****	
Stream classes are used to read and write bytes & Readers and Writers are used to read and write characters.
Since all of the file I/O on the exam is related to characters, if you see API class names containing the
word "Stream", for instance DataOutputStream, then the question is probably about serialization, 
or something unrelated to the actual I/O objective.
