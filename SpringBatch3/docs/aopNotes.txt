Aspect 	
	A module which has a set of APIs providing cross-cutting requirements. 
	For example, a logging module would be called AOP aspect for logging. 
	An application can have any number of aspects depending on the requirement.
	
Advice

	This is actual piece of code that is invoked during program execution by Spring AOP framework.
	
Join point
	This represents a point in your application where you can plug-in AOP aspect.
