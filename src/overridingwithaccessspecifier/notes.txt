1.	Protected display() method of Test class is overridden by Demo class with default 
	(not specified at all) access. It raises compilation error. The subclass can have 
	either same or stronger access like public or same protected. 
	But, it cannot have default or private.

2.	Why the methods of an interface should be overridden with public only?
	The methods of an interface must be public, if not mentioned, takes by default as public. 
	So, the subclass which implements the interface should override with the same specifier or more 
	but not less. No stronger specifier than public exists in Java. 
	For this, reason, all the methods of interface must be overridden with public only.
